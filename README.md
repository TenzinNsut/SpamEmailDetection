This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect spam emails. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails and can classify incoming emails as either spam or ham (non-spam).

## Introduction
Spam emails have become a significant problem, cluttering inboxes and potentially exposing users to malicious content. This project tackles the issue by developing a machine learning model that can accurately identify spam emails. By utilizing natural language processing techniques and a labeled dataset, the model learns patterns and characteristics of spam emails to make predictions on new, unseen emails.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is classified as either spam or ham. The dataset used in this project is the [Spam Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bagavathypriya/spam-ham-dataset/data), which contains a collection of emails along with their corresponding labels.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text data
- Feature extraction using natural language processing techniques
- Training a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Neural Networks) on the labeled dataset
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Prediction of spam/ham labels for new, unseen emails

## Model Performance
The performance of the spam email detection model can be evaluated using various metrics. Here are some example metrics:

- Accuracy: 97%
- Precision: 98%
- Recall: 89%
- F1-score: 93%

These metrics provide insights into how well the model can correctly identify spam and ham emails.
